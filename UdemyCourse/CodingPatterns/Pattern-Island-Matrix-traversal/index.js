/*

Many coding interview problems involve traversing 2D arrays (aka matrix or grid). The Island pattern describes all 
the efficient ways to traverse a matrix. This pattern will go through many problems to explain matrix traversal using 
Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) approaches and their variants. Letâ€™s jump onto our first problem
to develop an understanding of this pattern.
