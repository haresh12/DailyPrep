// Before we understand array we need to understand what is data structures so in this intro 
// we are going to talk about that only.

/* Data structures are ways to store the data and in different programing language we have
   different  data structure to store the data according to our needs or requirement.
   same thing we do at home like in school bages we store ours books and floder we store
   our files and in fridge we store fruites and all. And that is because those things are
   good at storing specific type of things. Same way when we do programing we have different
   data structure to choose on according to our requirement and needs.
 */

/*
  It would be good if we understand how our computer stores the data and also understand 
  below few words.
  1. RAM 
  2. Persistant storage (slower the RAM): 
  3. Catch 

  These all terms are releated to storage in our computer get more idea from wiki you will love it
*/

/*
   Now there are some comman operation that we are going to see in all of the data structure.
   1. insert : how easliy we can insert data
   2. delete : how easliy we can delete data
   3. traversal : looping througt the data
   4. searching : scan entire data and search for specific data
   5. sorting 
   6. Access

   Most of the time above are the 6 parameters that we are going to look for all the problems
   and will decide which data strucuture to use .

   Common Data Structure Operations : https://www.bigocheatsheet.com  good to look atleast once
