/*
   There is not much to write about dynamic programing because its not different data strucure
   nor the algorithm but its simply way to optimize you function call and as far as i know
   we basically use in recursion to optimize the repeating call and how we do that ? So
   basically we store each recursion call with its output and if next time we have same
   recursion call then we don't call that function but just get the answer from previous recursion
   call and we store all that in either in array or in object.


   IN VERY SIMPLE WORD AGAR FUNCTION ALREADY IN PAST HAS OUPUT SO NEXT TIME JUST DIRECTLY
   GET THE OUTPUT RETHER THEN CALLING THE FUNCTION AGAIN.

   THIS IS ALSO KNOWN AS MEMOIZATION ALSO THERE IS ONE MORE THING I CAME TO KNOW THAT
   WE CAN DO THAT WITH TABULATION ALSO BUT THIS IS TOTALLY NEW THING FOR ME SO MOST
   OF THE THINGS WE WILL TRY TO DO WITH MEMOIZATION TECHNIC.

   MEMOIZATION
   TEBULATION 

   THESE ARE THE THE TWO THINGS THAT NEED TO LEARN
