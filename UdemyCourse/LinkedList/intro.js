// LINKED LIST === MANAGING HEAD AND TAIL
// Ordered 
// Operation like push and pop will be O(1)
// No issue of colution because we our self manage where next node should be.
//
// push and pop O(1) // becasue you only need to manage tail.
// unshift and shift (1) because you only need to manage head no need to shift other data
// insert and delete O(n)
// search O(n) becasue you may know the value you need to search but you don't know the address of 
// node in which that value is stored. (FIRST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE O(1))
// ITS NULL TERMINATED MEANS LIST ENDS WHEN WE HAVE NULL VALUE AT END
