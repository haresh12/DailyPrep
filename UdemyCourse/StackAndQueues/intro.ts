/*
  So basically stacks and queues both linear data structure but with very limited functionality 
  or we can say they are kind of abstract over array in both of this data structure we don't
  have access of index and all.

  Stack : LIFO (Last In First Out) so in stack whatever item added last will be on that top
  and we will able to access top item always first.

  >> Operation in stack : 

     lookup :   O(n) // mainly we don't use look up in stacks
     pop : O(1)  // remove last item
     push : O(1) // add item at top of the stack
     peek : O(1) // get top or last added item of stack
*/

/*
 
    Queues : FIFO (First in first out) in this data structure whatever item you added first will
    be removed first and this is the only difference both data structures have like.

    Operations in queues :

    lookup : O(n) // same as queue we don't use lookup mostly
    enqueue : O(1) // to add item as top to queues
    dequeue : O(1) // to remove first items from queues.
    peek : O(1) // to access first item of queue.
