/*
   So till now all the data structure we have learned are linear data strucutre like all the 
   data stored in that is linear ex : array , stack , queue , linkedlist they all have data
   store one after another.

   >> Array : =>  10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 

  But in most the the case data stored is not linear example our file system so for that kind of data
  store we will need to use tree data structure.
  
  Now we have many types of tree like generic tree , binary tree , binary search tree but and first
  here we will learn about Generic tree.

   In all types of tree we need to remeber below few things.
   Root Node : => First node of the tree
   Parent Node : => Node that contains other nodes
   Child Node : => Node that are connected with parent node
   Sibling : => All the linear node connected with each other at each leave of tree
   Leaf Node : Node that does not have any child node or node that are at last level of tree
   are know as leaf node.

   How you will get data to draw the tree or to store the date in tree structure.
   
   SEE ITS VERY SIMPLE IF YOU UNDERSTAND EULER DIAGRAM SO IN THAT IF WE ARE IN PRE-AREA THEN WILL
   GET VALUE AND IF YOU ARE GOING OUT THE TREE MEANS IN POST AREA THEN YOU WILL GET -1 VALUE.
